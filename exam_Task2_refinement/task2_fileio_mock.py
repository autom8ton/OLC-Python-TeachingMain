# A text file shapes.txt stores a list of shapes 
# with a comma between each value.  

# The current contents of shapes.txt are: 
# star,sphere,square,triangle 

# A text file colours.txt stores a list of 
# colours with a comma between each value.  

# The current contents of colours.txt are: 
# red,yellow,green,blue 

# A program reads the data from each file and 
# creates a dictionary of the values so that each shape
#  has an associated colour. 
# The first value in each file will be joined, for example, star and red. 

# The data is stored in a global dictionary with the identifier data_store

#########################################
# Task A 6 - marks
# The function read_values() reads the data from both files 
# and stores the data in the global dictionary data_stored.  

# The data from the shapes.txt file is used as the key 
# and the data from the colours.txt file is used as the value. 

# The function needs to work for files of any length. 
# The files will always have the same number of data values. 

# Write program code for the function read_values().

# Task B -  4 marks
# The function output_result() asks the user to enter a shape 
# until the shape entered is found in the dictionary. 
# The colour for that shape is printed out. 

# Write program code for the function output_result().
