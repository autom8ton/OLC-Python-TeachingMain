# Task 4
# You have been asked to create a guessing game program.

# The program should:
# ·       Allow player 1 to input a whole number between 1 and 50 inclusive, for player 2 to guess. 
#         There must be validation present to check that the number entered is between a and 50 inclusive.

# ·       Allow player 2 to have 5 guesses to correctly guess the number input by player 1.
#         You do not need to validate the input for player 2.

# ·       Output “You guessed the correct number.” When player 2 inputs the same number as player 1. 
#         The game must end if the correct number is guessed.

# ·       Output “You did not guess the correct number.” When player 2 does not input the same number as player 1.

# ·       Output “Game over!” when player 2 has five incorrect guesses.

# 11.  When your program is complete, test it for the following:

# ·       Test 1 – Player 1 inputs the number 55
# ·       Test 2 – Player 1 inputs the number 0
# ·       Test 3 – Player 1 inputs the number 10 and player 2 guesses the numbers 15 and 10
# ·       Test 4 – Player 1 inputs the number 20 and player 2 guesses the numbers 30, 35, 22, 15, 49

# 12.  Save your program as MYGUESS2_<your name>_<center number>_<index number>.py

# Extend your program to identify if player 2’s guess is lower or higher than the number input by player 1. 
# A suitable message must then be output.
# Save your program.

# 13. 
# Extend your program to allow player 2 to choose an easy, medium or hard game. 
# An easy game allows eight guesses, a medium game allows six guesses and a hard game allows four guesses.

# If player 2 inputs a correct guess, the program must output the number of guesses made.

# You are not required to validate the input for player 2.

# Save your program.
