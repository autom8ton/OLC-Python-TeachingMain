# You have been asked to create a word game program for two players.
# 

# word = "SINGAPORE" 

# print(word.find("I")+1)


# The program must: 
# Allow player 1 to input a word that will be converted to lower case .lower()
# by the program after entry. The program must ask for another word each 
# time the player enters a word that is more than 10 letters. len() 
# while True:
#     word1 = input("Player 1, enter a word (10 letters or less): ").lower()
#     if len(word1) > 10:
#         print("Your word must be 10 letters or less.")
#     else:
#         # Output a message to state how many letters are in the word input by player 1. 
#         print("Your word", word1, "has", len(word1),"letters.")
#         break

print("SINGAPORE".replace("A","Z"))

# # Allow player 2 to enter a single lower case letter (on 10 separate occasions) 


    # Search for each letter input by player 2, in the word input by player 1 

        # Output “It is letter number X in the word.” Every a letter is found. 


# X must be replaced by the position of the letter in the word. 

# OUput “That letter is not in the word.: when player 2 
# inputs a letter that is not in the word. 

# Output “You have no entered 10 letters.” When player 2 has input all 10 letters. 

# Output “What is the word entered by player 1?” after player 2 has input 
# all 10 letters, and allow player 2 to enter the word. 
# This is converted to lower case by the program. 

# Output “That is the correct word. You win!” if player 2 inputs the same word as player 1. 

# Output “That is not the correct word. Player 1 wins!” if 
# player 2 does not input the same word as player 1. 

 

# Write your program and test that it works. 

# Save your program as WORDGAME1__<your name>_<center number>_<index number>.py 

# [13] 

 

# When your program is complete, test it for the following: 

# Test 1 – Player 1 inputs the word indescribable 

# Test 2 – Player 1 inputs the word excited 

# Player 2 inputs the letters a, c, s, i, m, d, u, e, o, t and inputs the word excited 

# Test 3 – Player 1 inputs the word xylophone 

# Player 2 inputs the letters e, f, u, o, I, p, h, d, c, t and inputs the word saxophone 

# Take a screenshot of Test 1 and Test 2. Save this single screenshot as : 

# TEST1and2_<your name>_<center number>_<index number>. 

 

# Take a screenshot of Test 3. Save this screenshot as: 

# Test3_<your name>_<center number>_<index number> 

 

# Save your file in either .png or .jpg format.

# Save your program as WORDGAME2__<your name>_<center number>_<index number>.py 

# Extend your program to: 

# Output a message to ask whether player 2 wants to enter the 
# word input by player 1, each time player 2 enters a correct letter 
# from the word. The program must then allow player 2 to enter 
# this word if the answer is yes. 

# Allow player 2 to enter another letter, even if the word they 
# input is incorrect. This is repeated until all 10 letters 
# have been input or the correct word is input. 

# Output a suitable message and end the game if, at any point, 
# player 2 inputs the correct player 1 word.
